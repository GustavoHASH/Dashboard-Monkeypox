# Dashboard-Monkeypox

This is a dashboard for tracking Monkeypox cases in SAO PAULO. The dashboard displays a map of the world with markers indicating the number of Monkeypox cases in each state(but since it's only in SÃ£o Paulo, it doesn't appear, but if you want, you can remodel it for other datasets that contain it).

## Technologies Used

The dashboard is built using the following technologies:

- Python
- Plotly
- Dash

## Installation

To install and run the dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GustavoHASH/Dashboard-Monkeypox.git`
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the dashboard: `python Dashboard.py`


The dashboard should now be running on localhost.

## Data Sources

The data used in the dashboard is sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) and is updated on a daily basis.
